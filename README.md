# 👋 Hey, I’m Noma!

💻 I’m a first-year Computer Science student fresh out of high school and already deep-diving into backend development. Python and Java are my main playgrounds — but through my first hackathon, I also dabbled in HTML, CSS, and Figma (frontend who?).

🚀 I recently helped my team win **3rd place at Hack Campus Life 2025**,
   where we built a campus food ordering system to solve long lunch lines and poor student eating habits. I’m all about turning real-life problems into actual solutions.

🌱 My goal? Master backend development — especially computer networks and information systems — *before* I tackle frontend properly. 
    I'm building my skills one system at a time.

🎮 I love gaming, especially indie open-world games (unless it's Red Dead Redemption or Call of Duty ).  

🧠 I’m passionate about:
- Backend systems & APIs  
- Computer networks & infrastructure  
- Creating things that make people's lives easier  
- Hackathons & collaborative problem solving

(GitHub DMs open too, I guess 😅)

⚡ Fun fact: I exist solely on the internet and run on tea, code, and ideas that I *must* bring to life.
